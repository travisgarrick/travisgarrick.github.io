									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a Data Analyst based in Acworth, GA. I've got a background in Psychology and analytical research and practices, and have honed my skills through Thinkful's Data Analytics program. Here you'll find a showcase of my projects utilizing skills in Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Python all to explore various datasets and provide insights pulled from those datasets. Each project involved exploratory data analysis, modeling, building dashboards, and presenting the key findings to a core audience. I also served as my own project manager, ensuring that the projects I completed adhered to the guidelines and deadlines given. My final project with Thinkful was a project of my own design, where I created the created a concept of the analysis and then completed its creation from concept to full fledged Jupyter Notebook analysis. At this time, I am open to contact about remote and in-person Data Analyst roles.</p>

									<h2>Why Data Analytics?</h2>
									<p>I've always had a passion for working with data, as that's part of why I studied Psychology in my undergraduate degree. Statistics and data for research appealed to me, so this career path was a logical choice. Initially I had planned to undergo graduate school to obtain a Ph.D. in Psychology for the purposes of research, but discovered the field of Data Analytics and learned I am drawn to the problem-solving aspect of data analytics. I find it incredibly satisfying to take a dataset and use it to uncover insights and make informed decisions. I also appreciate the versatile nature of the field - data analytics can be applied to practically any industry or type of business.
I am excited about the potential for data analytics to make a positive impact on society. By analyzing data, we can identify patterns and trends that could lead to better decision-making, improved efficiency, and better outcomes for individuals and communities.</p>

									<h2>What I bring to the table</h2>
									<p>I've got a background working in dynamic and fast paced environments and bring strong analytical skills that would be valuable in any company. I adapt to new goals and situations very quickly and can work on my own reliably or as a part of a team. Additionally, I have experience in project management, data analysis, and problem-solving, which I can apply to help improve processes and drive efficiencies. I am constantly seeking new challenges, and I am dedicated to continuous learning and professional growth.
Furthermore, I possess excellent communication skills, both verbal and written. I am comfortable working with people at all levels, from colleagues to senior executives, and I am able to present complex information in a clear and concise manner.</p>

							<h2>Projects</h2>
							<p>Below, you'll find a list of my projects that I've worked on through my Thinkful course and any personal projects that I've worked on outside of the course. These projects show proficieny in exploratory data analysis, modeling, building dashboards, and presenting the takeaways to an audience. Below are two Excel workbooks that utilize pivot tables and various statistical analyses to complete the goals of the projects. The Tableau workbook is a dashboard of a Superstore's data, and the Python Jupyter notebook contains a walkthrough of the dataset and analyses performed, as well as recommendations based on the analysis.</p>
